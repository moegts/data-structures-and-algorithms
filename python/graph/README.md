A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge Summary

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

- add node
- add edge
- get nodes
- get neighbors
- size
- bradth-first
