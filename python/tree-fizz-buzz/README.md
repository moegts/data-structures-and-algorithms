# Challenge Summary CC18

- [x] Write a function called fizz buzz tree
- [x] Arguments: k-ary tree
- [x] Return: new k-ary tree
- [x] Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
  - [x] If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with ‚ÄúFizz‚Äù
  - [x] If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù
  - [x] If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with ‚ÄúFizzBuzz‚Äù
  - [x] If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Efficiency
<!-- What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- [x] ‚è≥ = ‚≠ï(n)
- [x] üåå = ‚≠ï(n)
